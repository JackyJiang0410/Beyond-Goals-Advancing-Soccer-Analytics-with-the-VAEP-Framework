# Beyond-Goals-Advancing-Soccer-Analytics-with-the-VAEP-Framework

\section{Introduction}
Soccer is a game of intricate strategies and dynamic play, where the impact of individual actions on the game outcome often goes beyond what traditional metrics capture. Inspired by the work of Decroos et al.~\cite{Decroos2019ActionsSpeak}, this project aims to utilize StatsBomb data to apply and extend the VAEP methodology, offering deep insights into player contributions beyond goals and assists.

\section{Methodology}
This section outlines the data preprocessing steps to fit the SPADL format, the application of the VAEP framework for action valuation, and the analysis techniques used to derive insights from the processed data.

\subsection{Data Processing}
We transformed StatsBomb data into the SPADL format, ensuring a standardized representation of player actions, facilitating subsequent analyses.

\subsection{Action Valuation and VAEP Framework}
The VAEP framework evaluates each player action by estimating its impact on changing the probability of scoring and conceding goals. By calculating the difference in these probabilities before and after an action, VAEP assigns a numeric value to each action, reflecting its contribution towards a team's performance. This mechanism allows us to systematically assess the effectiveness of player actions in a way that traditional statistics cannot capture.

\section{Results}
Our comprehensive analysis using the VAEP framework on StatsBomb data revealed significant insights into individual player performances across the Premier League, as shown in Table~\ref{tab:top20_players}.

The results showcase the diversity of impact across teams and highlight players who may not always be in the spotlight yet contribute significantly to their teams' potential for scoring.

\subsection{Correlation Analysis}
Our findings exhibit a robust correlation coefficient of 0.923 between players' VAEP values and their teams' goal differentials, emphasizing the VAEP framework's capability to predict team performance based on individual contributions. The analysis between halves shows a correlation of 0.662, suggesting varying influences across the match that could affect player performance metrics.

\section{Conclusion}
Through the application of the VAEP framework to StatsBomb data, this project has illuminated the nuanced contributions of players beyond traditional metrics. Our analysis not only identifies the premier talents but also highlights unsung heroes, offering clubs a comprehensive tool for strategic planning and player development. By leveraging advanced analytics, we unlock new dimensions of soccer intelligence, fostering a deeper appreciation for the sport's complexity and strategic depth.
